# Overview
[CompTIA Network+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/network) validates the technical skills needed to securely establish, maintain and troubleshoot the essential networks that businesses rely on. It prepares candidates to support networks on any platform. CompTIA Network+ is the only certification that covers the specific skills that network professionals need.

This repository provides notes that I've constructed while studying for the Network+ exam. These notes are designed to be supplementary study material. This repository is in no way affiliated with CompTIA or Pearson VUE and makes no guarantees of accuracy or completeness.
